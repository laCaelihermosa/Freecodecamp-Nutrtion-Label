Typography

# The float property is used to place an element on the left or right of its container, allowing other content (such as text) to wrap around it.

# The rem unit stands for root em, and is relative to the font size of the html element.

# clear: "position where float was set"; clears the float position against out boundaries generated

# The :not pseudo-selector can be used to select all elements that do not match the given CSS rule.
